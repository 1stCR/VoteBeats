Status: 51/51 features passing (100%)

REGRESSION TESTING:
- Feature #11 (Delete event requires confirmation dialog): PASSED ✅
  - Created event "TEST_DELETE_EVENT_REGRESSION"
  - Clicked delete → confirmation dialog appeared with event name and warning
  - Cancel dismissed dialog, event remained
  - Confirm deleted event, redirected to dashboard with 0 events

- Feature #12 (Bulk reject requests requires confirmation): PASSED ✅
  - Created event "TEST_BULK_REJECT_EVENT" with 3 song requests
  - Selected 2 requests via checkboxes
  - "Reject Selected (2)" button appeared
  - Clicked → confirmation dialog showed count and warning
  - Cancel dismissed without changes
  - Confirm rejected both, moved to "Processed (2)" with "rejected" status
  - Third request remained in "Pending (1)"

- Feature #40 (Event selector dropdown in DJ top bar): PASSED ✅
  - Created 2 events (TEST_BULK_REJECT_EVENT, TEST_SECOND_EVENT_SELECTOR)
  - Clicked event name in sidebar → dropdown opened listing both events
  - Selected different event → URL changed, page updated with correct event data
  - Event name, date, location all updated correctly

BUG FIXES:
- Fixed React "Cannot update component while rendering" console error in LoginPage.js
  - Root cause: navigate() called directly during render when already logged in
  - Fix: Wrapped redirect logic in useEffect() hook
  - Verified: No more console errors on login page redirect

ALL REGRESSION TESTS PASSED. No regressions found.

NEXT SESSION:
- All 51 features are passing (100% complete)
