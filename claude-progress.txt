Status: 273/276 features passing (98.9%)

SERVERS:
- Backend restarted on port 3002 (was down between sessions)
- Frontend running on port 3000

BUG FIX - Event Settings Double-Encoding:
- DISCOVERED: Event settings were being double-encoded as JSON
  - EventCreatePage.js was calling JSON.stringify() on settings before sending to API
  - Server also called JSON.stringify(), resulting in double-encoding
  - When parsed back, settings came back as a string instead of object
  - Spreading a string in JS produces character-indexed properties {0:"{",...}
  - This broke ALL settings-dependent features: explicit blocking, profanity filter,
    voting schedule, request limits, queue visibility, etc.
- FIXED:
  1. EventCreatePage.js: Removed JSON.stringify() - send settings as plain object
  2. server/routes/events.js: Added parseSettings() helper for safe double-encoded JSON handling,
     settingsToJson() helper for safe DB storage, updated formatEvent()
  3. server/routes/requests.js: Added parseSettings() helper, replaced all JSON.parse calls
- VERIFIED:
  - New events store settings correctly (clean JSON object)
  - Existing events with corrupted settings are handled gracefully by parseSettings()
  - Explicit content blocking works (403 for explicit songs, 200 for clean songs)
  - Settings save round-trip works perfectly (load -> save -> reload stays clean)

REGRESSION TESTING:
- Feature #6 (Attendee cannot access DJ-only API endpoints): PASSED
  - POST /api/events without auth → 401
  - PUT /api/events/:id/requests/:id/status without auth → 401

  - Updated display name from "DJ Regression102" to "DJ Updated102"
  - Save Profile → "Profile updated successfully!"
  - Dashboard shows "Welcome, DJ Updated102" (persisted)

- Feature #18 (Explicit content blocking when enabled): PASSED
  - blockExplicit=true correctly blocks explicit-flagged songs (403)
  - Non-explicit songs pass through (200, queued)
  - Note: iTunes API returns "cleaned" versions, not "explicit", for most popular songs

CONSOLE ERRORS: Zero application JavaScript errors (only React HMR WebSocket expected)

MAJOR MILESTONE: ELECTRON DESKTOP HELPER APPLICATION
Built the complete Electron desktop helper application from scratch:

1. desktop-helper/package.json - Electron app config with win/mac build targets
   - Dependencies: electron-store, node-fetch, electron-updater
   - DevDependencies: electron, electron-builder
   - Build config: NSIS (Windows), DMG (Mac), GitHub Releases auto-update

2. desktop-helper/src/main.js - Full Electron main process (~630 lines)
   - BrowserWindow, Tray, Menu, ipcMain, Notification, dialog
   - electron-store for persistent settings
   - createTrayIcon() - generates colored 16x16 tray icons (green/yellow/red)
   - createMainWindow() - loads setup.html or main.html based on setupComplete
   - createTray() / updateTrayMenu() - system tray with context menu
   - checkSpotifyStatus() - polls localhost:4381 + fallback 4370
   - startSpotifyMonitoring() / stopSpotifyMonitoring() - interval-based polling
   - updateNowPlaying(track) - POST to server, falls back to offline queue
   - syncOfflineQueue() - batch sync accumulated offline updates
   - Song ending alert at 30 seconds remaining
   - Three automation modes: fully-automatic, semi-automatic, manual
   - Auto-start with system (app.setLoginItemSettings)
   - Auto-update via electron-updater (GitHub Releases)
   - Single instance lock via requestSingleInstanceLock()
   - Window close hides to tray instead of quitting

3. desktop-helper/src/preload.js - Secure context bridge
   - API methods: login, getEvents, selectEvent, startMonitoring, stopMonitoring,
     checkSpotify, confirmUpdate, completeSetup, setAutoStart, getAutoStart,
     checkForUpdates, restartAndUpdate
   - Event listeners: onTrackChanged, onMonitoringStatus, onConfirmNowPlaying,
     onSongEndingSoon, onNowPlayingUpdated, onNavigate, onUpdateAvailable,
     onUpdateDownloaded

   - Step 1: Server URL + email/password login
   - Step 2: Event selection from list
   - Step 3: Spotify detection check
   - Step 4: Configuration summary + Start Monitoring

5. desktop-helper/src/renderer/main.html - Main monitoring window
   - Now Playing: track title, artist, progress bar, elapsed/total time
   - Controls: Start/Stop Monitoring, Queue tab, Settings tab
   - Settings: automation mode, auto-start toggle, polling interval, reset
   - Confirmation dialog overlay for semi-automatic mode
   - Alert banner for notifications

6. server/routes/desktop.js - Server API endpoints for desktop helper
   - POST /api/desktop/auth - Authenticate with email/password
